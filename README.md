### üåü Introduction
As per Wikipedia, [Bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) are software applications that runs automated tasks over the Internet, usually with the intent to imitate human activity on the Internet, such as messaging, on a large scale.

Discord Bots are a vital component for a well-run [Discord](https://discord.com/) server. They can be used to automate moderation tasks as well as to add music, polls and much more. But just searching the internet for "Discord Bots" brings up millions of results that aren‚Äôt going to be a fun time to wade through.

### üåü Why this Project
We started the Discord Server at a time when many of our familiar Servers were subjected to attacks of Spam Bots. The commonly used public bots were compromized and every channel were flooded with spam messages. And above all, our requirement was so diverse, such that we couldn't find a single bot that can deliver everything that we needed.

### üåü About the Project
**InoBot** is the official Discord Bot of [**Inovus Labs**](https://inovuslabs.org/) Discord Server. It's a custom-built Discord Bot to effectively and efficiently manage the Discord Server and to maintain it lively.

**Inovus Ecosystem Architecture** is built in such a way that it minimizes the effort of accessing & managing the data of fellows. The ultimate [**Inovus API**](https://github.com/inovus-labs/inovus-api) is the backend of Inovus virtual Ecosystem. It explicitly handles the data part. The [**Inovus Scrapbook**](https://github.com/inovus-labs/scrapbook) and [**Inovus Profiles**](https://github.com/inovus-labs/inovus-profiles) projects are work in progress.
